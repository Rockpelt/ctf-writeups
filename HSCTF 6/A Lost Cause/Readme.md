# A Lost Cause

## Description

Pirate Keith loves cryptography and has protected his treasure with a very annoying caesar shift. He has witten 

“CGULKVIPFRGDOOCSJTRRVMORCQDZG” on his treasure chest and has left a piece of paper with the following message: 

“every subsequent letter is shifted one less than the previous.” Knowing this, can you unlock Pirate Keith’s treasure chest?

## Solution

At first the description was wrong and it said "every subsequent letter is shifted one __more__ than the previous."

So I trid to shift it back
